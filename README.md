# Welcome
Welcome to the 7th Cavalry IMO repository. Here we store items that are usfull to us, as well as the code base for our XF Addon 'CavTools'. We never push directly to the live branch, it is protected. Always make a branch of dev and create your feature in there. When testing it on the dev server, merge into dev. When we move a build the website, merge dev into live.

##### Summary:

***live*** -------> Live website. Do not work in whatsoever<br>
***dev***  -------> Dev site. Merge feature branches into here when testing on the dev site. Rollback if not functioning.<br>
***'feature'*** -> Feature area. This is where you work on your local system.<br>
